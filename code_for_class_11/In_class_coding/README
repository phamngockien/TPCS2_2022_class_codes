# THIS FOLDER INCLUDE A VERY SIMPLE PROGRAM
## It shows how to structure a program to header (.hpp) and source (.cpp) files
## The program seperate classes for reading from a file, writing to a file,
## and a class for storing the data.

### To compile the program:
### change the current directory to the src folder
### then we use the command:
### g++ main.cpp File_Stream_Prog.cpp Student.cpp
### this command will create an executable file in the src folder, for eg. a.out, a.exe

### To run the program:
./[executable_file_name] [/path/to/input_file] [/path/to/output_file]
